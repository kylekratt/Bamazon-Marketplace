# Bamazon-Marketplace
A market to buy and sell goods. The Bamazon Customer is able to choose goods from a list and purchase an integer number of the item using inquirer, as long as that item has sufficient quantity to supply that order. The total cost of their order is then displayed, and the database is updated to reflect the lowered quantity, while product_sales are increased by the cost of the order.

This is the table and options first displayed upon running bamazonCustomer.js
